Notepad#

This plugin implements all the features I wanted to see in Notepad++ for years.

Implemented so far:

- Proper new line inside DocBock for C, C++, Javascript, PHP
- Proper new line for # comment in Ruby
- Indent after opening curly brace for C-like languages
  and proper indenting for closing curly brace
- Delete current line keeping the column
- Undo closed tab
